**No extra sensors needed | Usable for micro:bits,b.boards**

The first time you start the code, you have to calibrate it(Default). Tilt the board until all the lights turn on.

The lights turn on the way you tilt the board. If it's balanced, smiley face appears.

You can change the sensitivity by changing the if arguments' x and y values.

.hex file for instant upload, .py for the code written in Python. You can't upload .py to board, It won't work.
Create a new project @ https://code.brilliantlabs.ca/# choose "Python", copy and paste the .py code and download the .hex file. 
Upload it to the board to start.
